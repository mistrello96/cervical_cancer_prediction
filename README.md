# cervice_cancer_prediction

In this project, me and my University colleague Daniele Papetti have developed a Knime Workflow to deal with an imbalanced class problem.
The workflow will cover data analysis, preprocessing and cleaning, data imputation oversampling, feature selection and extraction as well as models comparison and performance evaluation.
